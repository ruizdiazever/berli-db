## Steps

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

2. Run scripts

```bash
sh run_build.sh       # Build and run container
sh run_migrations.sh  # DB configuration and basic population
```

## pgAdmin

For a better experience use [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) to manage your database and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to manage the containers.
